          How can I join the private beta?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          First, you’ll need a Firefox account. Then, use your account to sign up for the waiting list. When a spot opens, we’ll send you an email with a link you can use to complete registration and start using Relay.

          What about spam?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          While Relay does not filter for spam, our email partner Amazon SES does block spam and malware. If Relay forwards messages you don’t want, you can update your Relay settings to block messages from the alias forwarding them. If you see a broader problem of unwanted email from all of your aliases, please <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/private-relay/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="text-link">report this to us</a> so we can consider adjusting the SES spam thresholds for this service.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          If you report these as spam, your email provider will see Relay as the source of spam, not the original sender.

          Can I reply to messages using my Relay alias?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Relay does not yet offer the ability to reply using an alias. If you try, nothing will happen. We are working on additional features to let you <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues/151" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-link">send an automated response</a> or <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/fx-private-relay/issues/99" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-link">reply anonymously to senders</a>.

        <h2 class="faq-headline">
          It seems like a site will not accept my Relay address or is blocking addresses using @relay.firefox.com. Why is this happening? What can I do about it?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          Some sites may not accept an email address that includes a subdomain (ie, the “relay” portion of @relay.firefox.com) and others have stopped accepting all addresses except those from Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo accounts. As Firefox Relay grows in popularity and issues more aliases, our service might be placed on a blocklist. If you are not able to use a Relay alias, please let us know.

          Can I make up my own relay address using the @relay.firefox.com domain?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
           Not currently, but we are considering new features including letting you create your own addresses with a designated domain.

          What happens if Mozilla shuts down the Firefox Relay service?
        </h2>
        <p class="faq-answer">
          We will provide users with advance notice that they will need to change the email address of any of their accounts that are using relay addresses.
